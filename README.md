The bacollite package offers a set of tools for aligning MALDI spectrum data with 'theroretical' peak positions that have been calculated from sequence and chemistry data. The alignment is carried out by cross-corelation and yields a correlation score and a lag score, both of which can be used to determine the presence or absence of a peptide in the spectrum. 

# Installation

# User guides

*`bacollite` is under active development. Please contact us or raise an issue if you need help!*

A vignette called "Aligning Samples To Peptides for Sheep, Cow, Goat and Deer" is available that will guide you through the process of loading data, aligning peptides and performing classifications. This can be found by typing `browseVignettes("bacollite")` at the R console. More vignettes will be added soon.
