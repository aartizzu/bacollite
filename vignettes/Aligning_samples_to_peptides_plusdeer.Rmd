# Introduction


This tutorial will show you how to load three replicates of a sample from files and align them with some peptides. We'll show the basic process first, and then give some details about how you would go about classifying the spectra based on peptide information. 

The bacollite package comes with some data files that we can use during this tutorial, but we need some R code to find where they are on our system. Let's get R to tell us the folder that the data is in: 

```{r}
fpath <- system.file("extdata",package="bacollite")
```

We'll be using the `fpath` variable in what follows. With your own data, you would know where this is on your system and you'd do something like `fpath <- "c:\mydata\"`


# How to load data

The files that we are using are called:

```
20150326_SF_YG65_94_I11.txt  
20150326_SF_YG65_94_I14.txt  
20150326_SF_YG65_94_I17.txt
```
You can see that the last part of the file name before the "." is the spot reference, and there are three spots: `I11`, `I14` and `I17`. We need this information to use the `load.sample` function to load the three samples into R, like this: 

```{r}
library(bacollite)
froot = sprintf("%s/20150326_SF_YG65_94_",fpath)
sample <- load.sample(froot = froot,spots = c("I11","I14","I17"),name="folio 42")
```

Let's go through this line by line: 

- `library(bacollite)` loads the package.
- `froot = sprintf("%s/20150326_SF_YG65_94_",fpath)` creates the text that is common to the file path of all three samples, based on the `fpath` text string that we created above.
- `sample <- load.sample(froot = froot,spots = c("I11","I14","I17"))` loads the data from the files into an R data object called `sample`. 

Let's have a look at the structure of the `sample` object using R's `str` function: 


```{r}
str(sample)
```

This tells us that `sample` is a list of five pieces of data:

- `name` - the name of the data. We called it "folio 42". Having names is useful when you are running lots of samples!
- `spot` - the three spot codes for the three samples
- `s1` - the sample data for the first file (`I11`)
- `s2` - the sample data for the first file (`I14`)
- `s3` - the sample data for the first file (`I17`)

Each of the three sample data entries in the list is a data frame containing the MALDI spectrum data that we'll use for the analysis. 

That's it for loading data. There are several additional options that you can use to load things like CSV files, or files with different extensions, which will be the subject of a future vignette

# Load some peptides

There are several sets of petide sequence that come with bacollite, but here we'll just use some simple ones to get started. The bacollite package comes with some sets of peptides that we can use to descriminate between samples from sheep, cow and goat, as described in paper [1] in the README file. lets have a look at these files. The peptides in `dm_sheep` look like this



```{r}
#dm_sheep
```

Those in `dm_goat` are: 

```{r}
dm_goat
```


...and those in `dm_cow` are: 

```{r}
#dm_cow
```


## Generating deer peptides. 


Here we have a concatenated sequence for deer collagen 1A1 and 1A2:

```{r}
deerseq <- "GPMGPSGPRGIPGPPGAPGPQGFQGPPGEPGEPGASGPMGPRGPPGPPGKNGDDGEAGKPGRPGERGPPGPQGARGIPGTAGIPGMKXXXGFSGIDGAKGDAGPAGPKGEPGSPGENGAPGQMGPRXXXXXXGRPGAPGPAGARGNDGATGAAGPPGPTGPAGPPGFPGAVGAKGEAGPQGPRGSEGPQGVRGEPGPPGPAGAAGPAGNPGADGQPGAKGANGAPGIAGAPGFPGARGPSGPQGPSGPPGPKGNSGEPGAPGSKGDTGAKGEPGPTGIQGPPGPAGEEGKRXXXGEPGPAGIPGPPGERXXXXXXGFPGADGVAGPKGPAGERGSPGPAGPKGSPGEAGRPGEAGIPGAKGITGSPGSPGPDGKTGPPGPAGQDGRPGPPGPPGARGQAGVMGFPGPKGAAGEPGKAGERGVPGPPGAVGPAGKDGEAGAQGPPGPAGPAGERGEQGPAGSPGFQGIPGPAGPPGEAGKPGEQGVPGDIGAPGPSGARXXXXXXXXXGVQGPPGPAGPRGANGAPGNDGAKGDAGAPGAPGSQGAPGIQGMPGERGAAGIPGPKGDRGDAGPKGADGAPGKDGVRGITGPIGPPGPAGAPGDKGETGPSGPAGPTGARGAPGDRGEPGPPGPAGFAGPPGADGQPGAKXXXXXXXXXGDAGPPGPAGPAGPPGPIGNVGAPGPKXXXGSAGPPGATGFPGAAGRVGPPGPSGNAGPPGPPGPAGKXXXXXXRGETGPAGRPGEVGPPGPPGPAGEKGAPGADGPAGAPGTPGPQGIAGQRGVVGIPGQRXXXGFPGIPGPSGEPGKQGPSGASGERGPPGPMGPPGIAGPPGESGREGAPGAEGSPGRDGSPGPKGDRGETGPAGPPGAPGAPGAPGPVGPAGKSGDRGETGPAGPAGPIGPVGARGPAGPQGPRGDKGETGEQGDRXXXXXXGFSGIQGPPGPPGSPGEQGPSGASGPAGPRGPPGSAGTPGKDGINGIPGPIGPPGPRXXTGDAGPAGPPGPPGPPGPPGPPKGPMGIMGPRGPPGASGAPGPQGFQGPPGEPGEPGQTGPAGARXXXXXXXXAGEDGHPGKPGRPGERGVVGPQGARGFPGTPGIPGFKXXXGHNGIDGIKGQPGAPGVKGEPGAPGENGTPGQTGARXXXXXXGRVGAPGPAGARGSDGSVGPVGPAGPIGSAGPPGFPGAPGPKGEIGPVGNPGPAGPAGPRGEVGIPGISGPVGPPGNPGANGIPGAKGAAGIPGVAGAPGIPGPRGIPGPVGAAGATGARGIVGEPGPAGSKGESGNKGEPGAVGQPGPPGPSGEEGKRGSTGEIGPAGPPGPPGIRXXXXXXXXXXXXXXAGVMGPAGSRXXXXXXXXXGPNGDSGRPGEPGIMGPRGFPGSPGNIGPAGKEGPVGIPGIDGRPGPIGPAGARGEPGNIGFPGPKGPTGDPGKAGEKGHAGIAGARXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXGEQGPAGPPGFQGIPGPAGTAGEAGKPGERGIPGEFGIPGPAGARXXXGPPGESGAAGPAGPIGSRGPSGPPGPDGNKGEPGVVGAPGTAGPSGPSGIPGERGAAGIPGGKGEKGETGIRXXXXXXXXXXXXGAPGAVGAPGPAGANGDRGEAGPAGPAGPAGPRXXXXXXGEVGPAGPNGFAGPAGAAGQPGAKGERXXXGPKGENGPVGPTGPVGAAGPSGPNGPPGPAGSRGDGGPPGATGFPGAAGRTGPPGPSGISGPPGPPGPAGKEGIRGPRGDQGPVGRTGETGASGPPGFAGEKGPSGEPGTAGPPGTPGPQGIIGPPGFIGIPGSRXXXGIPGVAGSVGEPGPIGIAGPPGARGPPGNVGNPGVNGAPGEAGRDGNPGNDGPPGRDGQPGHKGERGYPGNAGPVGTAGAPGPQGPVGPTGKHGNRGEPGPAGAVGPAGAVGPRGPSGPQGIRGDKGEPGDKGPRGIPGIKGHNGIQGIPGIAGHHGDQGAPGAVGPAGPRGPAGPSGPAGKDGRTGQPGAVGPAGIRGSQGSQGPAGPPGPPGPPGPPGPS"

deerpep <- parse.seq(deerseq)
```











OK, that gives us a set of peptides. We can find the sequences by looking at the `seqpos` variable for the other species, and looking for a peptide in that vicinity. We want peptides that correspond to the positions in the collagen that we used in the sheep cow goat study: 


```{r}
require(knitr, quietly = T)
kable(dm_sheep)
```




The sheep peptide with masses at 1180 and 1196 has a seqpos value of 1997, so let's list the deer peptides with a seqpos in a range around that value: 






```{r}
require(knitr, quietly = 0)
dp1 <- deerpep[deerpep$seqpos>1992 & deerpep$seqpos<2002 & deerpep$nglut == 0 & (deerpep$nhyd == 1 | deerpep$nhyd == 2),]
kable(dp1)
```

Great, it looks like we've found it, and the sequence is identical to sheep. 

Let's repeat the procedure for the seqpos around 1776: 


```{r}
require(knitr, quietly = 0)
dp2 <- deerpep[deerpep$seqpos>1771 & deerpep$seqpos<1781 & deerpep$nglut == 0 & (deerpep$nhyd == 4 | deerpep$nhyd == 5),]
kable(dp2)
```

OK, the final peptide has a missed cleave, so it's a bit more tricky to create. First, let's find the peptide 


```{r}
require(knitr, quietly = 0)
dp3a <- deerpep[deerpep$seqpos>550 & deerpep$seqpos<590 & deerpep$nglut == 0 & deerpep$nhyd ==1,]
kable(dp3a)
```




```{r}
require(knitr, quietly = 0)
dp3b <- deerpep[deerpep$seqpos>590 & deerpep$seqpos<610 & deerpep$nglut == 0 & deerpep$nhyd == 1,]
kable(dp3b)
```

OK, let's join these two peptides together like this: 

```{r}
dp3 <- dp3a
dp3$seq[1] <- str_c(dp3a$seq[1],dp3b$seq[1])
dp3$mass1[1] <- 2883.416491 #dp3a$mass1[1]+dp3b$mass1[1]
dp3$nhyd[1] <- dp3a$nhyd[1]+dp3b$nhyd[1]
kable(dp3)
```


Now we can make the set of deer peptides

```{r}
dm_deer <- rbind(dp1,dp3,dp2)
kable(dm_deer)
```









# Run the alignment

OK, now we've got a sample and some peptides, we can do alignments, using the ms_fit function. Let's do this for each set of markers:

```{r}
sheep_fit <- ms_fit(peptides = dm_sheep,sample = sample,doplot = F,force=T,gauss = 0.2)
cow_fit <- ms_fit(peptides = dm_cow,sample = sample,doplot = F,force=T,gauss = 0.2)
goat_fit <- ms_fit(peptides = dm_goat,sample = sample,doplot = F,force=T,gauss = 0.2)
deer_fit <- ms_fit(peptides = dm_deer,sample = sample,doplot = F,force=T,gauss = 0.2)
```


That's nice, but it's not very informative - even if we do `str(goat_fit)`. If we want to see nice plots of these, we can set the `doplot` option to `TRUE` and make a nice figure: 


```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=7}
par(mfrow=c(4,5))
gauss <- 0.2
sheep_fit <- ms_fit(peptides = dm_sheep,sample = sample,doplot = T,force=T,gauss = 0.2)
cow_fit <- ms_fit(peptides = dm_cow,sample = sample,doplot = T,force=T,gauss = 0.2)
goat_fit <- ms_fit(peptides = dm_goat,sample = sample,doplot = T,force=T,gauss = 0.2)
deer_fit <- ms_fit(peptides = dm_deer,sample = sample,doplot = T,force=T,gauss = 0.2)
```

The information in these plots is as follows:
- The x axis shows the mass range under consideration
- The y axis is a scale from 0 to 1
- Each sample is plotted with a coloured line *and* a grey line - aligned samples 1,2 and 3 are coloured red, green and blue respectively. There original (unshifted) mass positions are also indicated with a grey line. This is useful for *bad* alignments, because it becomes clear that 
- The intensity of each sample is scaled by the highest peak in the same spectrum. This allows for a better comparison across many peptides, becuase you see clearly where peaks are small. 
- The isotopic distribution of the target peptides is shown as a seris of five "pinheads". These are scaled by the relative value of the most common isotope. For lower masses, this is usually the first isotope but for higher masses it is usually the second. 
- As much information as possible is placed in the title of each plot, but this can be overkill if you want to see mmultiple plots in one figure as shown above. 




So now we have a set of correlation data for the sample with the peptide. The next step is to use this data to carry out a classification
 
# Perform a classification

We carry out a classification by passing the data objects we created with `ms_fit` into the classfier function `cor_id`. Let's write this as if it was a function first, then call it - that'll help us explain the process.

First we need to create a list of correlation structures like this

```{r}
cordata <- list()
cordata[[1]]<-sheep_fit
cordata[[2]]<-cow_fit
cordata[[3]]<-goat_fit
cordata[[4]]<-deer_fit
corlab <- c("Sheep","Cow","Goat","Deer")
```

The reason we put this data into a list is because we don't know in advance how many species we are trying to distinguish between.
If we have a list we can use a loop to iterate through every sample


```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=8}

#Arguments
cd <- cordata
labs <- corlab

#Function
corlim = seq(0,1,0.05)
scores <- vector(length = length(cd))
scores[] <- 0
laglim <- 0.6

#massage the raw cordata into a form we can work with: 
cld <- list()
for(cc in 1:length(cd)){
  cld[[cc]] <- corlim_data(cd[[cc]],laglim)
}

plot(x=corlim,y=cld[[2]]$nh,col="green",xlab="Correlation Threshold",ylab = "hit count",ylim=c(0,15))
points(x=corlim,y=cld[[1]]$nh,col="red")
points(x=corlim,y=cld[[3]]$nh,col="blue")
points(x=corlim,y=cld[[4]]$nh,col="black")



lines(x=corlim,y=cld[[2]]$nh,col="green")
lines(x=corlim,y=cld[[1]]$nh,col="red")
lines(x=corlim,y=cld[[3]]$nh,col="blue")
lines(x=corlim,y=cld[[4]]$nh,col="black")


legend("topright",legend = corlab,col=c("green","red","blue","black"),lty = 1,pch=1)
```

This gives us a clear graphical representation of the correlation scores. The final step in the classification is to combine this data into a score for each candidate species ID. Scores are accumulated for each correlation threshold value. For each given value and 

```{r}
#initialise the scores for each sample
for(ss in 1:length(cld))
  cld[[ss]]$cumscore = 0

for(cl in 1:length(corlim)){
  for(ss in 1:length(cld)){
    nh <- cld[[ss]]$nh[cl]
    maxonh<-0
    for(tt in 1:length(cld)){
      if(ss != tt){
        maxonh <- max(maxonh,cld[[tt]]$nh)
      }
    }
    
    if(nh > maxonh){
      cld[[ss]]$cumscore[cl] <- (nh-maxonh)*corlim[cl]
    }
  }
}

for(ss in 1:length(cld)){
 message(sprintf("Score for species %d (%s) = %f",ss,corlab[ss],sum(cld[[ss]]$cumscore)))
}
```

...From this output, we can see that our sample is unambiguously classified as sheep by this method.
