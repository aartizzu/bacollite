\title{Get the ratio of ion counts for two peptides}
\usage{
peptide.ratio(sample, peptide1, peptide2)

\arguments{
\item{sample}{the MALDI spectrum - three replictes, as loaded by load.sample()}

\item{peptide1}{the first peptide, which forms the numerator of the ratio calculation}

\item{peptide2}{the second peptide, which forms the denominator of the ratio calculation}
