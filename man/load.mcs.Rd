\title{Load peptides from the mammalian collagen sequences googlesheet and use the proline hydroxylation
probabilites contained in the sheet to estimate the probability of each number of hydroxyprolines in each peptide}
\usage{
load.mcs(spp = "human", sheet = bioarch_mammal_sequences, massmin = 800,
  massmax = 3500, verbose = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{spp}{the name of the species whose peptides will be loaded.}

\item{sheet}{the spreadsheet to load the data from. Must be the same format as bioarch_mammal_sequences, which is the latest version of the Bioarch mammal sequence dataset}

\item{massmin}{the minimum mass for a sequence to be returned. Defaults to 800}

\item{massmax}{the maximum mass for a sequence to be returned. Defaults to 3500}

\item{verbose}{verbose processing with more detail. Useful for debugging}
